# Little Esty Shop / Bulk Discounts

[Little Esty Site](https://lit-plains-74033-99e710147d26.herokuapp.com/)

## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

This project is an extension of the Little Esty Shop group project. Functionality was added for merchants to create bulk discounts for their items. A “bulk discount” is a discount based on the quantity of items the customer is buying, for example “20% off orders of 10 or more items”.

## Learning Goals for the Project
- building out a database schema with multiple relationships
- built rake tasks to import data from CSV files
- deployed project to heroku
- followed MVC architecture and REST routing
- followed TDD by testing with RSPEC, making and using factory bots as well as faker
- followed wireframes to design the frontend of our site
